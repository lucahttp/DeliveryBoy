## todo:
- make that if my bike goes forward it increases the speed of the street and the card comming from the back goes slower and the cars comming from the front goes faster, also the coins moves faster
- make that when I achive 6 kilometers a sprite shows on the side saying that "Thank you for the package and the speed"
- add more complexity
